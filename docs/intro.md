description: Expanse supercomputing cluster overview, technical details, resource allocation and job scheduling policies.
---

Expanse is a dedicated [Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services and Support](https://access-ci.org/) (ACCESS) cluster designed by Dell and SDSC delivering 5.16 peak petaflops, and will offer Composable Systems and Cloud Bursting.

Expanse's standard compute nodes are each powered by two 64-core AMD EPYC 7742 processors and contain 256 GB of DDR4 memory, while each GPU node contains four NVIDIA V100s (32 GB SXM2) connected via NVLINK and dual 20-core Intel Xeon 6248 CPUs. _Expanse_ also has four 2 TB large memory nodes.

Expanse is organized into 13 SDSC Scalable Compute Units (SSCUs), comprising 728 standard nodes, 54 GPU nodes and 4 large-memory nodes. Every Expanse node has access to a 12 PB Lustre parallel file system (provided by Aeon Computing) and a 7 PB Ceph Object Store system. Expanse uses the Bright Computing HPC Cluster management system and the SLURM workload manager for job scheduling.

Expanse supports the [ACCESS core software stack](https://access-ci.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PreReleaseDocumentation/pages/67716863), which includes remote login, remote computation, data movement, science workflow support, and science gateway support toolkits.

Expanse is an NSF-funded system operated by the [San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu) at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu), and is available through the ACCESS program.

## Resource Allocation Policies

- The maximum allocation for a Principle Investigator on Expanse is 15M core-hours and 75K GPU hours. Limiting the allocation size means that Expanse can support more projects, since the average size of each is smaller.
- Science Gateways requesting in the Maximize tier can request up to 30M core-hours.

## Job Scheduling Policies

- The maximum allowable job size on Expanse is 4,096 cores – a limit that helps shorten wait times since there are fewer nodes in idle state waiting for large number of nodes to become free.
- Expanse supports long-running jobs - run times can be extended to one week. Users requests will be evaluated based on number of jobs and job size.
- Expanse supports shared-node jobs (more than one job on a single node). Many applications are serial or can only scale to a few cores. Allowing shared nodes improves job throughput, provides higher overall system utilization, and allows more users to run on Expanse.
